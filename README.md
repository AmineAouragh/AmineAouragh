Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Amine](https://www.github.com/AmineAouragh) 

### My favourite programming languages/frameworks to work with:

<br />

<br />
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) - I think I should learn Django to add it too, Python looks so lonely here

### Database tools I've worked with:
![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqlite-%2307405e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)

### IDEs I've worked with (I don't know why I am including this section here, what is the point of this?)
![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)
<br />
![PyCharm](https://img.shields.io/badge/pycharm-143?style=for-the-badge&logo=pycharm&logoColor=black&color=black&labelColor=green) - only for Python
<br />
![IntelliJ IDEA](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJIDEA-000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=intellij-idea&logoColor=white) - for Java projects
<br />
![Eclipse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Eclipse-FE7A16.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Eclipse&logoColor=white) - I am only including Eclipse here to say that the one above it is much better
<br />
![RStudio](https://img.shields.io/badge/RStudio-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=rstudio&logoColor=white) - used it for a Big Data course with R in my Masters Program
<br />
### Some really amazing - 100% FREE - platforms that helped me a ton:
![FreeCodeCamp](https://img.shields.io/badge/Freecodecamp-%23123.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=freecodecamp&logoColor=green)
<br />
<br />
![MDN Web Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/MDN_Web_Docs-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=mdnwebdocs&logoColor=white)
<br />
![edX](https://img.shields.io/badge/edX-%2302262B.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=edX&logoColor=white) - to obtain certificates you have to pay but hey... don't cry, trust me that most courses there are worth it if you know where to look + a solid side project you built using knowledge and skills you acquired are worth more than any certifications ðŸ¤«
<br />
![Duolingo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duolingo-%234DC730.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Duolingo&logoColor=white) - alright listen up, I know this one has absolutely nothing to do with tech but if I wasn't ðŸ’˜ IN LOVE ðŸ’˜ with Spanish I wouldn't have included it here ðŸ˜œ
